## üíª [Getting started](https://github.com/andreped/ohif4hf#getting-started)

_**NOTE:** The project is a work-in-progress. The final plugin(s) are yet to be added. Stay tuned!_

### ü§ó [Deployment](https://github.com/andreped/ohif4hf#deployment)  <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/andreped/neukit"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-yellow.svg"></a>

The solution is deployed on Hugging Face (HF) spaces. Click the badge above to access it.

The web app is also deployed on [my personal website](https://andreped.github.io/demos/2023/ohif-plugin/), using HF for hosting the solution.

### üê≥ [Development](https://github.com/andreped/ohif4hf#development)

```
git clone https://github.com/andreped/ohif4hf.git
docker build --no-cache -t ohif4hf .
docker run ohif4hf
```

To go inside docker image and debug, at the bottom of the Dockerfile, add `ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/sh" ]` before running.

## üëè [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/andreped/ohif4hf#acknowledgements)

I did not develop OHIF, only implemented some plugins and showcased deployment on Hugging Face space.

Credit should be given to the developers of OHIF for making such an amazing open software solution!

I also want to acknowledge [@radames](https://github.com/radames) at Hugging Face for assistance with HF space integration.
